# Alpaca-board
An Open Source keyboard designed for Kailh Low Profile Switches.

This keyboard is meant to be ultra portable, using the [Kailh Low Profile](https://novelkeys.xyz/products/kailh-low-profile-switches)
switches and a minimalist design. That being said, I wanted to add all the keys that I miss when typing on my 40% and 60% boards, such as arrow
keys, Home, End, Delete, Up and Down. I also decided to use USB C as the connector, since I perfer the form factor and flexablility for future
designs. The keyboard will be fully customizable through QMK, the software of which will be coming up soon.

I hope that by keeping this project Open Source, other designers can use my work as a base to get up and running quickly. Feel free to use my 
notes and ideas, but please adhere to the [Open Hardware License](https://www.oshwa.org/definition/)

Enjoy!
